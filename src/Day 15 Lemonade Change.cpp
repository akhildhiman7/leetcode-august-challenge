/**
 * @file Day 15 Lemonade Change.cpp
 * @brief Solution to the LeetCode problem "Lemonade Change"
 * @link https://leetcode.com/problems/lemonade-change/
 * 
 * Algorithm Explanation:
 * 
 * Problem Statement:
 * You are given an integer array `bills` where `bills[i]` can be 5, 10, or 20 dollars. You start with no change in hand.
 * Return `true` if you can provide every customer with the correct change, or `false` otherwise.
 * 
 * Intuition:
 * The core idea is to simulate the process of giving change to customers. You need to keep track of the number of 5-dollar 
 * and 10-dollar bills you have because the 5-dollar bill is crucial for making change, and the 10-dollar bill can help minimize 
 * the number of 5-dollar bills you use.
 * 
 * Approach:
 * - Iterate through the list of bills.
 * - For each bill:
 *   - If the bill is $5, increase the count of 5-dollar bills.
 *   - If the bill is $10, ensure you can give back $5 in change (check if you have a 5-dollar bill), and update the counts accordingly.
 *   - If the bill is $20, prioritize giving back a $10 and a $5 bill as change. If thatâ€™s not possible, give back three $5 bills.
 * - If at any point you cannot give the correct change, return `false`.
 * 
 * Time Complexity:
 * - O(n), where `n` is the number of bills. We iterate through the list of bills once.
 * 
 * Space Complexity:
 * - O(1), as only a fixed amount of extra space is used to store the counts of 5-dollar and 10-dollar bills.
